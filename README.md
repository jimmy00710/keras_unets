# KERAS UNETS

A common UNETs class where you tweak something and you can get result on different-different architecture. I am planning to add vgg16, resnet32, resnet34, densenet, xceptionnet. I am also thinking of adding attention ( CBAM ) in it. In this way we will have one common class with a lof of different architecture to train from.  

> Added Densenet169 and XceptionNet. 

We can also add one more block in decoder to test it performance. Currently we start from 32 feature vector, but we can start from 16 also.
